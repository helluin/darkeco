This repo is for a data viz project as part of the "Floating Studio of Dark Ecology"'s project in the summer of 2015, led by Marina Zurkow, Adjunct Professor at ITP, Tisch School of the Art, NYU.

This is my first D3 project. I tried to visualize what issues bio- or eco- artists in and around the Greater NY area are dealing with. The aim is to see if there is any patterns and trends in the art scene, and thus make this project helpful for artists and researchers locate themselves in today's eco-art landscape.
